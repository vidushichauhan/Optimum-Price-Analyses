## Features

- Input product specifications including price, product name, number of reviews, and star ratings.
- Retrieve optimal pricing suggestions from the backend.
- Display the optimal price to make the product a best seller.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/optimal-price-frontend.git
   cd optimal-price-frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   ng serve
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Enter the product specifications including price, product name, number of reviews, and star ratings.
3. Click the "Get Optimal Price" button to retrieve the optimal price suggestion from the backend.
4. The optimal price will be displayed on the screen.

## API Endpoints

The backend service provides the following API endpoints:

- **GET /api/optimal-price**

  Request parameters:
  - `price` (number): The current price of the product.
  - `productName` (string): The name of the product.
  - `numberOfReviews` (number): The number of reviews the product has received.
  - `starRatings` (number): The average star rating of the product.

  Response:
  - `optimalPrice` (number): The suggested optimal price for the product.

### Example Request

```sh
GET /api/optimal-price?price=29.99&productName=Example+Product&numberOfReviews=100&starRatings=4.5
```
